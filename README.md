# movement_game

In this project, I want to determine the last position of a object given its steps. All steps carry a unit of 1. For example, Up(U) has 1 unit, Left(L) has 1 unit, Right(R) has 1 unit and Down(D) has 1 unit. It is similar to determining where a object's final coordinate will be given its previous steps
